# How to Generate a Slip File for Delphi XE3
 
Delphi XE3 is a powerful and versatile integrated development environment (IDE) for creating Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android applications. However, to use Delphi XE3, you need to activate it with a valid license key and a slip file. A slip file is a small file that contains information about your product edition, serial number, and registration code.
