The game is currently available on Steam, where it has received mostly positive reviews from players who appreciate the quality of the graphics, the depth of the characters, and the variety of the choices.

If you are looking for a game that offers a compelling and immersive story with multiple endings, a game that challenges you to make difficult and moral choices that affect your family members, a game that features realistic and detailed 3D graphics and animations, and a game that explores the dark and taboo side of human sexuality, then Dual Family may be the game for you.
